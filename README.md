Sebastian Turner is a Graphic Designer, Web Developer and Motion designer

I loved getting my hands on Lego or Play-Doh and building wacky things or creating art on paper with Crayola’s—that snapped when I pushed too hard. I was proud of my work and showed it off to mom & dad or whoever would listen. But I also loved the process of creating it, the steps I took to get there and how it progressed over time to the final piece it became. When I see other people’s process in creating their art it inspires me to create my own.

Now I want to share that creative and inspiring feeling with whomever will listen and let me create kickass work for them. I want to help build your world of Lego, or laugh while we ideate and break crayons together. I want every person I work with to experience the same feelings I have while creating new things and have a blast doing it.
