  Objektiv was used because of its display like attributes. Its black font is very impactful which is well suited for news information. Its modern style was chosen on purpose for clean readability while also letting the viewer know that the information is up to date. Even if the theme is retro.

visual_info: |
  The overall visual design is retro 8-bit gaming. Since the market of gamers are generally mid to adult males, the goal was to appease their childhood nostalgia of gaming. To do this I used a very pixel stylized approach because that is a significant part of gaming history. In fact it's where a lot of fond childhood video game memories began.
