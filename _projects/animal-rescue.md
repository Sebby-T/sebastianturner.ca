  Freedom Dog Rescue was a case study project. I took an existing animal rescue website that was… less than optimal, and I improved on it. Adding in responsiveness, accessibility and an overhaul in visual design.

color_info: |
  Black and white were chosen as the primary colours for background and body copy since they give a sense of professionalism and create easy readability. For the accent colours the blue-black colour helps the site separate from being overly designed and makes it more approachable. While the orange—used sparingly—as call to action and attention grabber since it creates great contrast.
main_colors:
  - "#000000"
  - "#ffffff"

  Roboto was chosen as the primary font because of its web readability. While Raleway was chosen for the main headers of the website. Both fonts pair nicely together and fit a modern and friendly feeling for the website. This helped push the professional feeling of the website and make it more approachable for families looking to adopt.

target_info: |
  This website was aimed at young couples and families who are animal lovers and are looking to too add to their family but also save a pet’s life if not by adoption then through donations. This means they are caring, loving and compassionate.
visual_info: |
  The new visual design was aimed at making the site modern, professional and approachable. It was a balance of colours, imagery and text to make the site feel trustworthy and show that they cared for their website as much as they do finding pets a safe and caring home.
