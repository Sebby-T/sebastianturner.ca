  By timing and easing geometric elements with a catchy soundtrack I showcase my ability to follow animation principles. From storyboard roughs to the final piece, this case study will show you my thoughts and process from start to finish.

color_info: |
  Colours were to create a happy and upbeat feeling to match the beat of the music. When paired with the dark background it created a nice balance between the colours. Yellow and pink are colours that are very much associated with happiness, joy and warmth which suited the music very well.

visual_info: |
  For the overall visual design I wanted it to feel like with matched the music. The music used a low bass guitar with a repeated snap of the fingers through out. This made the video feel deep and a little rough. So I felt that a rough, grainy texture would be a perfect fit for the overall visual appearance.
